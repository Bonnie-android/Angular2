# Angular2

Angular is component based. 
A component is a class with a view template and a decorator. A component consists of three main things Template, Class and Decorator.

The view template defines the user interface. The template contains the HTML, directives and data bindings.

The class contains the code required for the view template. A class in Angular contains properties and methods. Properties contain the data for the view template and methods contain the logic for the view.
Typescript is used to implement classes in Angular. 

The decorator component is provided by Angular which adds metadata to the class. Once we decorate a component class with a decorator it becomes an Angular component.

The AppModule is the root module that bootstraps and launches the application. The components must be imported and declared here.
